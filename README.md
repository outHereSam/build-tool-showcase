# Build Tool Showcase

A small web application that demonstrates the use of various build tools and package managers. This project aims to assess my understanding on build processes, dependency management and basic web development concepts. The main build tool used here is Webpack.

## Setup Instructions

- Clone this repository using git clone
- Navigate into the directory of the project and run `npm install`. This should install all the dependencies for the project.
- To run the development server, run `npm start`. This automatically opens the project in the browser and watches for changes.
- To build the project with webpack, use `npm run build` command.
